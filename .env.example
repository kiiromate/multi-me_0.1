# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ============================================
# 
# For Local Development:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the values with your actual credentials
# 3. Never commit .env.local to version control
#
# For Netlify Deployment:
# 1. Go to Site configuration → Environment variables
# 2. Add all variables above with your actual values
# 3. Trigger a new deploy after adding variables
# 4. Keep SANITY_API_TOKEN and CONTACT_WEBHOOK_* server-side only
#
# For Vercel Deployment (alternative):
# 1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
# 2. Add each variable for Production, Preview, and Development
# 3. Redeploy after adding variables
#
# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================
#
# These variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ which means
# they are exposed to the browser. This is safe because:
# - Sanity content is public (read-only)
# - No write tokens are included
# - No sensitive API keys are exposed
#
# DO NOT add sensitive keys (API secrets, tokens) here
# without removing the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix and ensuring
# they are only used server-side.
