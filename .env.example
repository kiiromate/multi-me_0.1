# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================
#
# These variables are prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ which means
# they are exposed to the browser. This is safe because:
# - Sanity content is public (read-only)
# - No write tokens are included
# - No sensitive API keys are exposed
#
# DO NOT add sensitive keys (API secrets, tokens) here
# without removing the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix and ensuring
# they are only used server-side.
