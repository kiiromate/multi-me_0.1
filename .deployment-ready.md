## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before You Deploy

1. **Sanity Setup Required**
   - Ensure Sanity project is created
   - Have project ID ready
   - Content should be published

2. **Domain Access**
   - Ensure you have access to Porkbun account
   - Domain kazekeza.com should be active
   - Be ready to update DNS records

3. **GitHub Repository**
   - Code should be pushed to GitHub
   - Repository should be accessible
   - Main branch should be stable

### During Deployment

1. **DNS Propagation**
   - Can take 15-60 minutes (sometimes longer)
   - Don't panic if domain doesn't work immediately
   - Use whatsmydns.net to check progress

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - Provisioned automatically by Netlify
   - Requires DNS to be propagated first
   - Usually takes 1-5 minutes after DNS is ready

3. **Build Time**
   - First build may take 3-5 minutes
   - Subsequent builds are faster (2-3 minutes)
   - Check deploy logs if build fails
