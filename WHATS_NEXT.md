## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: What's the most important thing to do first?**
A: Set up Sanity and add your real content. Without content, nothing else matters!

**Q: Should I do SEO or analytics first?**
A: Set up analytics first (easier, 20 mins). Then work on SEO gradually.

**Q: I don't have many projects yet, what should I do?**
A: Start with 2-3 projects (even small ones). Quality > quantity. Add more as you build them.

**Q: Do I need to do everything at once?**
A: No! Follow the week-by-week plan above. Rome wasn't built in a day.
