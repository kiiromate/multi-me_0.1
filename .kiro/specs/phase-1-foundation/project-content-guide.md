Multi-Me Portfolio: Building in Public
```

**Slug:** (Click "Generate" button)
```
multi-me-portfolio-building-in-public
```

**Description:**
```
A meta-documentation of building this portfolio itself. This project showcases the journey of creating a modern, accessible portfolio using Next.js 15, Sanity CMS, and creative coding with p5.js. Built with a focus on performance, sustainability, and the "Multi-Me" concept - embracing multiple facets of identity through design and technology.
```

**Content:** (Rich text editor - expand on the build process)
```
This portfolio represents more than just a showcase of work—it's a living document of the creative and technical process behind modern web development.

Built with Next.js 15 and the App Router, this site leverages server components for optimal performance while maintaining rich client-side interactions through Framer Motion and custom p5.js animations. The content management is powered by Sanity CMS, providing a flexible and developer-friendly editing experience.

Key technical decisions include:
- Server-first architecture with strategic client components
- Glass morphism design with honey accent colors (#EBA937)
- Custom canvas animations capped at 30fps for performance
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Optimized image delivery through Sanity's CDN
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

The "Multi-Me" concept is woven throughout, celebrating the intersection of data visualization, creative coding, and thoughtful design. This portfolio embraces multiple facets of identity—developer, designer, data storyteller, creative coder—without forcing them into a single box.

Technical Stack:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Sanity CMS for content management
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Framer Motion for animations
- p5.js for custom canvas work
- Radix UI for accessible components

The build process emphasized sustainable web development practices, with careful attention to bundle size, animation performance, and accessibility standards.
