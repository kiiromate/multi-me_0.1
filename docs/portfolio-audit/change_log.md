# Change Log: Content Review & Parity Alignment

## What Changed vs Current On-Site Text
- **Hero & The Human Deduplication**: The Origin hero now strictly introduces the Ops & Implementation proposition ("Simple Tools. Massive Operational Leverage."), while "The Human" focuses exclusively on the operating environment and philosophy ("Translating Complexity into Pipeline Discipline"). They no longer duplicate the same introductory paragraph.
- **Nav Labeling Unified**: Removed extraneous pattern naming loops. Forced singular conventions: `Origin`, `The Human`, `Craft`, `Notes` (formerly Journal/Blog redundancies), and `Connect` (formerly Signal). 
- **CTAs Fixed in FR**: Replaced all literal translation of "Connect" ("Se connecter", which implies logging into an account) with professional intents: "Me contacter" / "Démarrer une conversation / Entrer en contact".
- **Defensible Language Replaced Absolutes**: Scrapped claims like "unprecedented pipeline discipline". Integrated verified metrics directly into the copy: *+30% operational efficiency*, *-25% reporting time*, and *+15% retention via onboarding*.
- **Data Viz Re-positioned**: The overarching brand is now undeniably Operations/CS. "Creative Coding/Data Viz" is completely stripped from core headings and metadata, positioned only as a "Lab" experiment inside Craft or a "Bee analytics" analogy inside Notes.

## Remaining Placeholders Needed Before Launch
- **None.** The previous placeholders (`[METRIC_X]`) have been fully populated with your verified CV numbers. The content is perfectly structured and 100% complete for direct Sanity seeding.
